/**
 * Assembles a cPanel/Passenger-ready bundle from a standalone build.
 *
 * Run with:
 *   BUILD_STANDALONE=1 NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=... NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=... npm run build
 *   node scripts/package-cpanel.mjs
 *
 * Produces dist-cpanel/, which is what gets uploaded. Everything the app
 * needs is inside it — including node_modules — so cPanel never has to
 * run an install step.
 *
 * NOTE: NEXT_PUBLIC_* values are inlined into the client bundle at build
 * time, so they must be correct when `npm run build` runs, not when this
 * script runs. Runtime-only secrets (the Supabase service-role key, mail
 * credentials) are set in cPanel's environment variable panel instead
 * and must never be baked in here.

//    Two things are wrong by default on CloudLinux/cPanel:
//
//    HOSTNAME is set by the platform to the physical server's hostname
//    (e.g. "premium42.web-hosting.com"). Next's standalone server does
//    `process.env.HOSTNAME || '0.0.0.0'` and then binds to it, which
//    fails with EADDRNOTAVAIL because that name doesn't resolve to a
//    local interface. Clearing it restores the 0.0.0.0 default.
//
//    NODE_ENV may be unset, and Next needs production to serve the
//    prebuilt output rather than looking for a dev server.

// 4. A dependency-free manifest. node_modules is already bundled, so if

//    to resolve the full dependency tree on a shared host.
